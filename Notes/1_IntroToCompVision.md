### Introduction to Computer Vision

#### Notes
1.
  - Computer vision refers to how machines/computers visually perceive the world and react to it.
  - Bees have compound eyes with about 30000 lenses. The final image is a $\sum$ of all input lenses. Though the image is low-resolution, however it is great at detecting the motion quickly.

2.
  - **Computer vision techniques will be useful for any data, that has what we call, “spatial coherency”**
  - Spatially coherent data can be thought of as any data that predictably varies over space
  - Examples
    - Self-driving cars: Used for vehicle and pedestrain recognition
    - Medical image analysis and diagnosis
    - Photo tagging and face recognition

3. Computer Vision Course Overview
  - **Intro to Computer Vision**, which covers topics like image processing, feature extraction done manually or through training a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch
  - **Advanced Computer Vision and Deep Learning**, which is all about advances in deep learning architectures like region-based CNN's, YOLO and single-shot detection algorithms, and CNN's used in combination with recurrent neural networks
  - **Object Tracking and Localization**, which covers how a robot can move and sense the world around it, creating a visual representation of the world as it navigates

4.
  - NVIDIA DRIVE AGX is a scalable, open autonomous vehicle computing platform that serves as the brain for autonomous vehicles
