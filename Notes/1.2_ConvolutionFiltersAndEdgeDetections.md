#### Notes

2. **Frequency in Images**
- **Frequency** in images is a rate of change. Rate of change in the intensity or brightness.
- **High-frequency components also correspond to the edges of objects** in images, which can help us classify those objects.
- The output of a Fourier transform (FT)represents the image in the frequency domain. In the frequency domain, the mages with a lot of high-frequency components (edges, corners, and stripes), there will be a number of points in the frequency domain at high frequency values.
- FT treats patterns of intensity in an image as sine waves with a particular frequency.
- FT's can be done with **OpenCV**. For more info, see [FT in OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_transforms/py_fourier_transform/py_fourier_transform.html).


5. **High-pass filters**
- In general filters are used to:
    - Either filter out unwanted information
    - or amplify the features of interest
- High-pass filters are used to:
    - Sharpen an image
    - Enhance high-frequency part of the image
- Edges are areas were pixel intensity changes very quickly and they often represent the object boundaries
- A high-pass filter such as
![NULL](./figures/5_highpass0.jpg)
can be used for edge-detection
![NULL](./figures/5_highpass1.jpg)
by convolving the filter with the image (`filt * im(x,y) = im'(x,y)`)

**NOTE**: Make sure the sum of weights in the filter is zero, otherwise it can lead to brightening or darkening of image. This might not be desirable in the edge-detection.

6. Edge-Handling
  - In order to handle the kernel convolutions for the edge pixels, we can do the following:
    - **Extend**: the edge pixels are extended as far as necessary to provide values for the convolution.
    - **Padding**: The image is padded with a border of 0's, black pixels
    - **Crop**: Any pixel in the output image which would require values from beyond the edge is skipped. This method results in images that are slightly smaller.

8. **Gradients and Sobel filters**
- **Gradients** are a measure of intensity change in an image, and they generally mark object boundaries and changing area of light and dark.
- The **Sobel filter** is very commonly used in edge detection and in finding patterns in intensity in an image. Applying a Sobel filter to an image is a way of taking (an approximation) of the derivative of the image in the x or y direction.

- You can use sobel_x and sobel_y to find the intensity and the direction of the edges.

10. **Low-pass filters**
- Its useful to apply them before any high-pass. Avoids the amplification of noise.

11. **Gaussian blur**
- It can easily be implemented in OpenCV

16. **Canny Edge Detector**
- Canny Edge detection function in OpenCV is useful for creating binary edge images

17. **Shape Detection**
-  How can we begin to find unifying boundaries around objects? We'll want to be able to do this to separate and locate multiple objects in a given image. Next, we'll discuss the **Hough transform**, which transforms image data from the x-y coordinate system into Hough space, where you can easily identify simple boundaries like lines and circles
