#### Notes

##### The lesson deals with how to create feature vectors that can then be used to recognize different objects 
2. **Feature vectors**
 - It is a vector that contains important information that can used to descrive the object's important characteristics.
 - For e.g., we can have a feature vector that contains the direction of gradients of the following trapezoidal image. This can be used a feature vector, with some modifications, can be used to detect a trapeziod in the images.

3. **Real-time feature detection**
  - It is important to detect the features efficiently and quickly for the real-time detection. ORB is one tool that can used to quickly create the feature vectors that can be used for quick object-detection.
4. **Introduction to ORB**
  - Oriented Fast and Rotated Brief
  - ORB starts by finding the special regions in the image called keypoints. Keypoints represent the special region in an image that is particularly distinctive. For e.g., corners. 
  - For each keypoint, ORB creates a corresponding feature vector (binary) that represent the patterns of intensity around a key point. 
  - ORB is impervious to noise, illumination and image transformations such as rotations.
5. **FAST**
  - Features from Accelerated Segments Test
  - FAST is the algm used to find the keypoints in the image
  - It compares the brightness of p to a set of 16 surrounding pixels that are in a small circle around p
  - The reason FAST is so efficient, is that it takes advantage of the fact that the same result can be achieved by comparing p to only four equidistant pixels in the circle. Then it looks for atleast 2 conscutive points thata either brighter or darker than p
  - This reduces the search by a factor of 4

 6. **BRIEF**
  - Turns the keypoins to binary feature vectors length (128-512 bit string)
  - Binary feature vectors can be efficiently stored and computed upon with limited resources
  - BRIEF : 
    - Smooth the image by gaussian kernel
    - Select random pair of points around the keypoint
    - First point from a Gaussian dist. centered around the keypoint with std. of sigma
    - Second point from a Guassian dist. centered around the first with std. of sigma/2
    - Value is 0 if 2 brighter 1 otherwise 1
    - repeat

 7. **Scale and Rotation invariance**
  - ORB first builds an image pyramid, it contains the sequence of images at different resolutions. Each level downsampled (reduced in resolution) to the previous level.
  - Then, it finds the keyppoints using FAST for each of these levels. By doing so it makes ORB partially scale invariant
  - For keypoints at each level, it assigns orientation
  - Then, it uses modified version of brief called rbrief (rotation-aware brief) to make feature vectors which are orientation independent. Thus making ORB rotation-independent.
  - ORB descriptor : The set of all the feature vectors for all the key points found in an image

  8. Feature matching
    - We compare the ORB descriptor between the training and the query image using some matching function (say, hamming that finds the num. of dissimilar bits) and recognize the training image in the query image
